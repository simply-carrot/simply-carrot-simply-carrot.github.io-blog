        title: "Why Thomas More Still Matters in an Age of Moral Flexibility",
        date: "February 2025",
        category: "Religion & Law",
        content: `
            As a first-year law student who is in the process of converting to Catholicism, 
            I find myself returning again and again to the figure of St. Thomas More. 
            Here was a man of brilliance, humor, political insight, and legal mastery—
            yet when the moment of testing arrived, he refused to bend his conscience to the demands of power.
            <br><br>
            What strikes me most is not simply More’s martyrdom, but the ordinary consistency of his life. 
            He never separated his legal training from his moral convictions. 
            He never imagined he could create one persona for public life and another for private devotion.
            <br><br>
            In today’s culture—where political expediency is traded like a currency—More’s witness is not 
            merely historical. It is a roadmap. A reminder that the law, divorced from moral truth, becomes a tool of coercion rather than a guardian of justice.

        title: "The Conservative Case for Ordered Liberty",
        date: "January 2025",
        category: "Politics",
        content: `
            Among young conservatives, I often hear a tension between libertarian impulses 
            and a longing for moral order. As someone studying constitutional law, I sympathize 
            with both instincts. Yet a society cannot survive on “leave me alone” alone.
            <br><br>
            Ordered liberty—the foundational idea behind the American political tradition—reminds us that 
            freedom is not simply the absence of restraint. It is the ability to pursue the good, 
            within a framework that protects human dignity.
            <br><br>
            If the conservative movement is to regain its cultural footing, it must articulate a vision 
            of liberty that rejects authoritarianism without collapsing into indifferent permissiveness. 
            The family, faith, and local communities are not obstacles to freedom; they are its preconditions.
