    <h1>Why Thomas More Still Matters in an Age of Moral Flexibility</h1>
    <div class="meta">February 2025 · Religion & Law</div>

    <p>
        As a first-year law student who is in the process of converting to Catholicism, 
        I find myself returning again and again to the figure of St. Thomas More. 
        The more I read about him—not just in <em>A Man for All Seasons</em>, but in his own letters—the more
        his life exposes the thinness of so much modern talk about “following one’s conscience.”
    </p>
    <p>
        More did not treat conscience as a free-floating feeling, but as a judgment rooted in 
        objective moral truth and the teaching of the Church. That is precisely why his stand 
        against Henry VIII was so costly. If conscience is simply preference, it can always be 
        negotiated or managed. If conscience is an encounter with truth, it becomes something you 
        are willing to die for.
    </p>
    <p>
        In law school, we are trained to separate our “professional” selves from our deepest 
        convictions—often in the name of neutrality or pluralism. Yet More’s life suggests that 
        the great danger is not that Christians will impose their faith on others, but that we will 
        quietly bracket it off, treating it as irrelevant to questions of justice, authority, and 
        the common good.
    </p>
    <p>
        For someone like me, standing at the threshold of the Church, More’s martyrdom is 
        both intimidating and strangely consoling. It reminds me that the Catholic faith is not 
        a lifestyle accessory I can bolt onto an existing career plan. It is a claim about what is 
        ultimately real—and about the kind of person I am called to become, even if that eventually 
        puts me at odds with the powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
        In an age that prizes moral flexibility, Thomas More still matters because he shows us what 
        fidelity looks like when every worldly incentive points the other way. The law needs that 
        kind of courage again. So do I.
