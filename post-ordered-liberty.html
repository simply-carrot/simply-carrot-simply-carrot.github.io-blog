    <h1>The Conservative Case for Ordered Liberty</h1>
    <div class="meta">January 2025 · Politics</div>

    <p>
        Among young conservatives, I often hear a tension between libertarian impulses and a 
        longing for moral order. As someone studying constitutional law, I sympathize with both 
        instincts. Government overreach is real, and instinctive resistance to state power is often 
        healthy. But a society cannot be held together by “leave me alone” as its highest ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The American founding speaks not just of liberty, but of <em>ordered</em> liberty. 
        The phrase is not a hedge or compromise; it is the whole point. Liberty without order 
        becomes license, and order without liberty degenerates into soft despotism. 
        The conservative project, at its best, is the patient defense of institutions
        that make genuine freedom possible: the family, churches, local associations, 
        and the rule of law.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the vantage point of a law school classroom, it is easy to turn these institutions 
        into abstractions. But I grew up watching what happens when they break down: 
        when fathers disappear, when neighborhoods decay, when schools give up on forming the young. 
        In that light, the conservative concern for “intermediary institutions” is not nostalgia; 
        it is triage.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the conservative movement is to regain its cultural footing, it must recover the language 
        of ordered liberty. That means defending free markets while recognizing that markets alone 
        cannot answer questions of meaning and belonging. It means protecting individual rights 
        while acknowledging that rights make sense only within a moral framework we did not create 
        and cannot simply edit on demand.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ordered liberty will never be as rhetorically exciting as revolution or radical autonomy. 
        But for a serious conservatism, it is the only real path forward: freedom rooted in 
        responsibility, oriented toward the good, and sustained by communities that teach us 
        how to use our freedom well.
